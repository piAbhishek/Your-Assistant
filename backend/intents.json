Construction Technology is the oldest engineering discipline aftermilitary engineering. It is traditionally broken into several sub-disciplines including environmental engineering, geotechnical engineering, structural engineering, transportation engineering, water resources engineering, materials engineering, coastal engineering, surveying, and construction engineering. Construction Technology takes place on all levels, hence the department of construction Technology was started in this institute from the academic year 2009-2010. The department is at present conducting one diploma course."
